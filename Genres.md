*Return to [HOME](https://lauramarott.github.io/SocialGraphs/)*

The genres are investigated to see how they relate to the success of a given movie. In the dataset one movie can be assigned several genre and therefore each movie can be a part of more genres in the below analyses. 
The investigation here consists of the following parts:
* Understanding the Genres
* Wordclouds
* Collocations
* Sentiment Analysis
  * Positive Wordclouds
  * Negative Wordclouds

Let us dive into it!

### Understanding the Genres

The first thing is to understand the behaviour of the genres in terms of successfulness, which is here evaluated on the parameters IMDb-score (rating), Facebook likes, budget and profit:

First of all, the above shows that all movies have a rating around the median at 6.5 found in the [Basic Stats](https://lauramarott.github.io/SocialGraphs/BasicStats) but some outliers are seen. For instance, Biography and History have a high average rating. The reason for this might be that they are "niche-movies", where the viewers are really interested in that kind of movies and therefore give high ratings. 

In terms of profit, Animation and SciFi have the highest profit. These movies contains many special effects which indicates that this is what the viewers want to see. 

This have provided an overview of how the genres behaves compared to each other. We are now ready to continue the investigation.
