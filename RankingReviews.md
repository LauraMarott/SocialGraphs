*Return to [HOME](https://lauramarott.github.io/SocialGraphs/)*

This investagation aims to analyse the three ranking groups found based on the 33 % and 66 % percentile from [Basic Stats](https://lauramarott.github.io/SocialGraphs/BasicStats). Here, the user reviews of the movies are analysed using text analysis. Hopefully, this text analysis will provide insight in what the users think and experiences regarding the three rating groups.

This text analysis is divided into three parts:
* Wordclouds 
* Collocations
* Sentiment analysis

Let's go!
